## Issues During Development

During development I had one major issue - all config nodes were updating after any change. After making little research I've discovered a `trackBy` function that can be used create custom tracking logic for ngFor directive. Thanks to this function editor is now much more performant.

## Ideas for Improvement

- [X] Add new key
- [X] Edit existing key
- [X] Change field type
- [X] Clone object in lists
- [ ] Add code editor (switching between gui/text editor)
- [ ] Add option to select file save format - json/yaml
- [ ] Add filter keys functionality
